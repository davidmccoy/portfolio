David is one of the most impactful people at [the company], and one of a handful who I believe are critical to our success with [major partner] and beyond. A little of what makes him so valuable:

1. He enables PMs to make sound product decisions. **He clearly communicates all possible options and tradeoffs, and makes recommendations that balance engineering quality with business needs considerations.** We are able to move quickly and confidently because he intentionally gathers all the context he needs to make good recommendations, which in turn allows him to create alignment across the team.
2. **He gets the best out of his teams**, whether by mentoring junior colleagues, generating consensus amongst disagreeing teammates, or making space for fun at work. If I am good at my job, it is in large part because of the time and energy David has put into guiding and supporting me.
3. **He transforms product teams as soon as he arrives.** It is no secret that having David as your team lead means that your team will produce meaningful results quickly, guaranteed. This is well demonstrated by the [struggling team] situation earlier this year â€” we had been spinning for weeks without forward progress, but had a complete [product experience] within two weeks of him joining the team.
4. He is currently driving alignment amongst the [product and engineering] teams to ensure that we deliver the expected product before the [major partner] launch in January.
