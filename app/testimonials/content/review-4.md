David does just about everything well. I don’t think I’ve ever seen him less than 100% on anything he’s touched. A few things he’s done exceptionally well:

1. **He is an expert in [the business]**, and therefore takes a nuanced approach to any problem. He has intentionally prioritized understanding the product, our users, the [business domain], our codebase, and the needs of the business. **He has done this so effectively that he catches holes in product designs and implementation that nobody else would have caught.**
2. He prioritizes robust testing before launching big features to customers.
   - We have had significantly fewer bugs this year than we did the previous year, and that’s in no small part due to David building testing time into his project plans.
3. **He continuously pushes for what he knows is right for the customer, and effectively highlights _why_ it’s the right thing.**
   - When I was on vacation this summer, he successfully advocated to extend the team's mission to meet a key customer need. As a result, we decreased the portion of customers receiving inaccurate [deliverables] from 65% to 0%.
4. He creates a lighthearted, fun, yet focused environment **so teammates feel safe to express their thoughts and make bold decisions.**
5. He takes the initiative to do what needs to be done, even if it’s outside of his responsibilities entirely.
   - Examples include saving us from a $30k [SaSS] contract, performing a data audit, and [a proof-of-concept product experiment].
6. **He gives really thoughtful and actionable feedback.**
   - When I asked him for feedback on some [new product] onboarding slides, he spent > 1 hour talking through all the tactical ways I could improve them. As a result, 100% of our first customer’s employees rated their onboarding presentation as a 5/5, and none of them were concerned about how the program works.
