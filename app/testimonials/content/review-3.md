I've often been the youngest, most feminine, and least experienced person in a room. I'm used to fighting to be taken seriously, and I thought that joining [the product and engineering organization] would make it harder.

**But you instead valued the expertise I came in with and spent time helping me develop product management skills, making me feel empowered where I expected to be made to feel incompetent. I don't think that I would have as positive relationships as I do with the rest of the team, if you hadn't gone out of your way to make them possible.**

You are someone I trust and respect and you're invaluable to me as a person.
