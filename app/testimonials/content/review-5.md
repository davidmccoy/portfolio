David does a great job of organizing and taking the engineering lead on mission teams. **David's done a tremendous job helping not only the PMs stay organized and on track but the engineers as well.** He unblocks where we need and is always being available to answer questions and find answers if needed. David is also such a great team player and goal/mission oriented.

David has had a HUGE impact [here] - there's not a single feature/bug/mission that he isn't apart of. **He is definitely someone you WANT on these as well as his attention to detail on technical needs and guidance.** David's knowledge with what [our product] is from an engineering standpoint to where it can go is deep. He has fantastic ideas and an excellent understanding of prioritization that helps us build what we need, when we need it.

David a tremendously awesome teammate and we are lucky to have him here at [company].
