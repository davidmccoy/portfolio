- **David is quite frankly the biggest driver on, and advocate for, our team.** He asks the right questions, he is quick to execute on priorities, and he does an excellent job working and communicating effectively with everyone.I could not ask for a better Team Lead – and partner – on the team.
- **David is exceptional at driving projects and filling the gaps, be it in engineering, or product, or process.** This has been exemplified in the delivery of our new tax credits dashboard and the work we’ve done on optimizing out qualified research expense classification and calculation.
- **He has led a campaign to move away from our default-waterfall engineering process to dedicated scrum process** – a method that has proved to be highly effective and resulted in our teams completing their engineering work faster and in a more predictable manner.
- He organizes engineering reviews, plans and builds out engineering work, and takes the lead during team meetings. He does this all while still making significant contributions as an engineer.
- I see a lot of potential for David continuing to be a prominent voice for our product and our engineering organization. **He cares deeply about what we are building and the people that are building it. He has done his part in trying to improve our fragmented culture.** [...] David has done a phenomenal job advocating for a more iterative approach on launching projects. I would love to see him continue to grow as the driving force he is, and the integral part of the organization he has become.
