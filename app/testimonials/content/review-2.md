[B]ecause I don't think you hear enough how wonderful you are to work with, I've talked with three other people this week about why you're the right person to lead [the next big project] and I'm tell you the reasons that came up the most:

- **You're an all-around great engineer and creative problem-solver**
- **You're an effective leader, especially in situations like [the next big project] where there's a lot to do at pretty high stakes.**
- Your dedication to and passion for your work is infectious and inspires others to do their best.
- You create a lighthearted and fun environment in group meetings so people feel safe to express what they need to express.
- You're very supportive and a great mentor. I don't think the value of your support can be overstated.
- You know the business and technical things that are important to make [the next big project] successful.
- **You actually get [our business domain]. Not just conceptually but very tactically, and better than almost anyone here, including ops.** You *really* understand business context and how it informs which tradeoffs we should be making.
- **And when you don't know something you make it a point to learn it well. So well that you find holes we otherwise wouldn't have noticed until a customer did.**
- You think about things holistically so we can make the right calls
- You prioritize the customer experience in all its facets — ease of use, receiving quality deliverables, understanding the value of the product, etc
- Because you get [our business domain] and business context so well, you know how to break down work in the way that makes the most sense
- You're a strong communicator
- **[Other PM] and I were talking the other day about how easy you make it for us to make product decisions**, because you explain options and tradeoffs so well and your recommendations are always balanced with engineering quality and business needs considerations
- Because I'm the product lead on [the next big project] - you understand what I'm trying to say and ask good questions to get me to think through the things I'd overlooked
