## Ownership/Urgency

David takes the projects he works on very seriously, and the business impact they have even more so. **When I told him about how our backs were against the wall with our [SaSS] plan due to the way we had implemented [its integration] in the past, he jumped in without hesitation. What I thought was impossible to rectify in only two weeks, David proved otherwise.** Because of his initiative to act and the ownership he embodied in implementing a solution, we were able to move off the [SaSS] plan and save $30k/year.

## Influence

**David’s push to move toward more focused, intentional projects designed around shipping smaller milestones helped us to adopt mission-based teams.** These have led to the successful launch of numerous new features. David also led those teams, and helped build the framework of how a successful mission operates. Even on missions he isn’t directly involved in, or ideas/concepts that have yet to be turned into a mission, David helps guide engineers and product managers. One great example is his work in advocating for a formal data model of our [core data that was (at the time) unstructured data]. The [team that later took that work on] was able to leverage that concept, and David worked with [that team's TL] and team on creating the designs.

## Culture

David was the biggest advocate for a more agile process designed to produce smaller, shippable chunks. This has reverberated throughout the [product and engineering organization] where we now see other members of the team breaking up work into milestones with off-ramps baked in. He also pushes us to improve the way we handle PR reviews, improving the PR review process and better setting the expectations we should have of one another on giving quality feedback. David plays a big role in showing up and helping refine our team building and customer-focused sessions as well. He helped us in building back up our engineering all-hands, and is always there for [customer support call/sales call] reviews.
