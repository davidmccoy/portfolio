David led [his product team] into and through a very successful [business cycle]. **Many lessons were learned from the previous year, and David made sure we did not repeat any of the same mistakes.** The exceptional planning he put into that team’s projects allowed us to sail smoothly even when he was out on leave. And as a result, no one left that team bitter or feeling burnt out.

David displayed incredible levels of leadership on the teams he was a part of. On [hist first product team], aside from the amazing progress they made on our [product] experience, **David made the controversial decision to extend the target date so they can deliver the [new feature]. He weighed the value it added to the customer experience (and business) over the missed target - and it was the right decision.** Thanks to this, we reduced the portion of customers receiving inaccurate [deliverables] from 65% to 0%.

On [a different, struggling product team], the mission was spinning its wheels for a few weeks. **Then David joined - within two weeks the team was transformed and completed [the first iteration of the product experience].** This was one of the best examples of David’s skills in project planning and engineering leadership.
