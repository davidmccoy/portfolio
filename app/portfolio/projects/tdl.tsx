          <strong>Team Magic League</strong> (ne√© Team Draft League) was born in
          2013 when a group of Brooklyn-based <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>{' '}
          players wanted a way to organize and track team drafts. We formed a
          league &mdash; and what does every league need? Schedules, results
          pages, and leaderboards. So I stepped in and built my first
          actually-used-by-real-people side project.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking back on the code base is an exercise in cringing over and
          over. It&apos;s a basic CRUD Rails app with a lot of poorly thought
          out data modeling, incorrect use (or pure ignorance of) Rails
          conventions, or really any best practices, and just a lot of beginners
          mistakes. But I&apos;m incredibly proud that a group of 20-30 people
          used this site for years to keep our little league going.
        </p>
        <p>
          The core functionality of the app was the creation of a league,
          seasons, teams, and players. Those teams (usually made up of three
          people) would schedule matches against each other, where players would
          play everyone on the other team in 1v1 matches of <em>Magic</em>. The
          results would be reported on the website, aggregated to create
          seasonal leaderboards, personal statistics, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          I stopped actively developing the site in 2015 as the original
          incarnation of TDL ceased operations.
